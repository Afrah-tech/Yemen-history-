                <p> The Old City of Sana'a, a UNESCO World Heritage site, is renowned for its unique, multi-story tower houses made of rammed earth (a mix of clay and water) with intricate carvings and geometric designs. These buildings are distinctive due
                    to their construction techniques and the decorative friezes. Shibam: Known as the "Manhattan of the Desert," Shibam is famous for its mudbrick skyscrapers, some of which are over 500 years old. This ancient city is one of the oldest
                    examples of urban planning based on vertical construction.</p>
